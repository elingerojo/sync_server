# SyncServer

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nponiros/sync_server/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nponiros/sync_server)

## Synopsis

A small node server which uses [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) to write data to the disk. The server can be used with a client for example [SyncClient](https://github.com/nponiros/sync_client) to save change sets which can later be synchronized with other devices. The server was made to work with the [ISyncProtocol](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Dexie.Syncable.ISyncProtocol) and [Dexie.Syncable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dexie-syncable). It currently only works with the poll pattern.

## Installation and usage

Install globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g sync-server
```

Before using the server it has to be initialized with:

```bash
sync-server init
```

The `init` action must be executed in an empty directory which will later be used to store the data. This folder represents a Database. During initialization a `config.json` file is create with the default server configuration.

You can start the server with:

```bash
sync-server --path INIT/DIRECTORY/PATH
```

The `--path` flag must be given the path to the directory in which `init` was called.

### Default settings

These settings are written in a file called `config.json` in the directory in which `init` was called. The config file is split into 4 sections: `db`, `logging`, `server`,  and `sync`.

#### db

| Setting name      | Value                   | Description                                                                                                    |

| connector         | 'NeDB'                  | The database used to store the data. Currently only [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) is supported |
| opts              | {}                      | Options for the database. These depend on the selected connector                                               |

__NeDB Options__

The `sync-server` supports the following NeDB options:

* inMemoryOnly
* timestampData
* corruptAlertThreshold

The [NeDB README](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb#creatingloading-a-database) contains more information about these options.

#### logging

| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| errorLogFileName  | 'error.log'             | File name for the error log. Contains information about exceptions and rejected promises        |
| accessLogFileName | 'access.log'            | File name for the access log. Contains information about the requests made against the server   |

#### server

| Setting name      | Value                   | Description                                                                                     |

| partialsThreshold | 1000                    | If we have more than 1000 changes to send to the client, send only the first 1000 and `partial: true` |


### Node.js Version

You need to use a new version of Node.js as the code uses ES2015 features which are not available in Node.js versions < 6.0.0.

## API

### Synchronization

* URL: `/`
* Method: `POST`
* Params: JSON with
  * baseRevision: number (It is set to `0` if it is not defined)
  * changes: Array<ChangeObj>
  * clientIdentity: number (The server generates one if it is not defined)
  * syncedRevision: number (It is set to `0` if it is not defined)
  * requestId: any
  * partial: boolean (If `true` this is a partial synchronization. Default is `false`)
* Return: JSON with
  * changes: Array<ChangeObj>
  * currentRevision: number
  * clientIdentity: number (The newly generated clientIdentity or the one that was provided by the client)
  * partial: boolean (This is a partial synchronization. The `partialsThreshold` number defines when we only send a partial synchronization)

#### ChangeObj

There are 3 types of `ChangeObj`. See also [Dexie.Syncable.IDatabaseChange](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Dexie.Syncable.IDatabaseChange)

__CREATE__

Object with:
* type: 1
* obj: Object (The object to add to the database. Must also contain the `key`, but does not have to use the `key` property )
* key: any (The unique ID of the object. Is also contained in `obj`)
* table: string (The name of the table to which the object belongs to)

__UPDATE__

Object with:
* type: 2
* mods: Object (Contains only the modifications made to the object with the given `key`)
* key: any (The unique ID of the object. Is also contained in `obj`)
* table: string (The name of the table to which the object belongs to)

__DELETE__

Object with:
* type: 3
* key: any (The unique ID of the object we want to delete)
* table: string (The name of the table to which the object belongs to)

### Online check

Can be used to check if the server is online.

* URL: `/check`
* Method: `HEAD`
* Params: None
* Return: Headers

## Running the tests
